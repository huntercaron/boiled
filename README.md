# Boiled
A minimal & opinionated Gatsby boilerplate.

Basic setup of [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) with [Styled-Components](https://www.styled-components.com/), and [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/).

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/huntercaron/boiled)


## Getting Started

### Things you Need Installed
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

### After installing, clone the repository using either the terminal or Github Desktop.

### Setup and Running

Then in your terminal, cd to the directory and run `yarn`.
This will install all the dependencies for the project.

Once that is done, get the site running and live-reloading by running `gatsby develop`.

You're good to go!

For other Gatsby commands look [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).
I also strongly recommended the Gatsby tutorial [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).
If using Netlify, simply commit to your site and it will rebuild.
If using Github pages, follow the guide [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/deploy-gatsby/#github-pages).
