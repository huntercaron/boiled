A minimal & opinionated Gatsby boilerplate.

Basic setup of Gatsby with Styled-Components, and page generation using markdown.

## Getting Started

### Things you Need Installed
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

### First clone the repository using either the terminal or Github Desktop.

Then in your terminal, cd to the directory and run `yarn`.
This will install all the dependencies for the project.

Once that is done, get the site running and live-reloading by running `gatsby develop`.

You're good to go!

For other Gatsby commands look [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).
I also strongly recommended the Gatsby tutorial [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).
If using Netlify, simply commit to your site and it will rebuild.
If using Github pages, follow the guide [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/deploy-gatsby/#github-pages).

## Extras
### Recommended Tools
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) \(Text Editor\)
  * [Language Babel Package](https://github.com/gandm/language-babel) \(for proper React Syntax Highligting\)
  * [Atom IDE](https://ide.atom.io/) \(error reporting, auto completion & more\)
* [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) \(Great Dev-Tools\)
* [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) \(A nicer terminal\)
