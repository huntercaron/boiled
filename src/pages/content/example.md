description: >
  Sometimes pages have little bits of text rather than a main body section for weirder layouts. Formatting text in frontmatter like this allows you to have named little nodes of information. See how they are used in the 'example-page' template.
  When you want a larger block of text, you add that little > up there and it allows you to kinda type a large block
