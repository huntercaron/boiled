## This is a test post.

These can be anything you want, I just named them posts so it makes sense in a blog format.

The info at the top of this file is called 'front-matter' and you can add anything you want up there.

In the `templateKey` field above you can see this post will use the post template.

## Images

You can add images by linking to them `s` ![whatever alt text](../../assets/images/sloth.jpg)
